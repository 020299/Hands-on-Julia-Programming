# Hands-On Julia Programming

An Authoritative Guide to the Production-Ready Systems in Julia

This is the repository for [Hands-On Julia Programming](https://in.bpbonline.com/products/hands-on-julia-programming?_pos=1&_sid=ec3d83bca&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications.

## About the Book
The Julia Programming language enables data scientists and programmers to create prototypes without sacrificing performance. Nonetheless, skeptics question its readiness for production deployments as a new platform with a 1.0 release in 2018. This book removes these doubts and offers a comprehensive glimpse at the language's use throughout developing and deploying production-ready applications.

The first part of the book teaches experienced programmers and scientists about the Julia language features in great detail. The second part consists of gaining hands-on experience with the development environment, debugging, programming guidelines, package management, and cloud deployment strategies. In the final section, readers are introduced to a variety of third-party packages available in the Julia ecosystem for Data Processing, Text Analytics, and developing Deep Learning models.

This book provides an extensive overview of the programming language and broadens understanding of the Julia ecosystem. As a result, it assists programmers, scientists, and information architects in selecting Julia for their next production deployments.
